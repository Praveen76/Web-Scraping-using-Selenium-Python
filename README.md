# Images' web-scraping-using-Selenium-Python

Data mining or gathering data is a very primitive step in the data science life cycle. As per business requirements, one may have to gather data from sources like SAP servers, logs, Databases, APIs, online repositories, or web.

Tools for web scraping like Selenium can scrape a large volume of data such as text and images in a relatively short time.

# **Directory Structure**
* **Dataset1 :** All images
* **Dataset2 :** Images for Car, and horses class. You can scrape images for classes of your choice. Go through the code to get more details.
* **Image Web-Scraping_Part1.ipynb:** Python notebook for image webscrapping.
* **Image Web-Scraping_Part2.ipynb:** It's almost the same code like one in Image Web-Scraping_Part1.ipynb notebook, but I've put the code in seperate functions to make it more modular and readable.

# **Instructions for Installation:**
**Dependencies:**
 * selenium: 4.8.2
 * PIL: 7.0.0
 * requests: 2.22.0
 * webdriver_manager: 3.8.5

The code has been tested on Windows system. It should work well on other distributions but has not yet been tested.
